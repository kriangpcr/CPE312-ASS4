# Binary Classification Streamlit App for Mushroom Edibility

📖 **Introduction**  
This project is a Streamlit-based application designed to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous using Machine Learning. The app leverages a trained model to provide accurate predictions based on mushroom features. This project is part of the **CPE312**.

📊 **Objectives**  
- Develop a user-friendly application for mushroom classification.
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.
- Visualize classification results using metrics and graphs.

🗂️ **Dataset**  
UCI Mushroom Dataset: This dataset contains features such as color, shape, and odor, which are used to classify mushrooms into two categories: edible and poisonous.

⚙️ **Installation**  
To run the application, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

🚀 **How to Run**  
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the app using Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

📈 **Features**  
- Upload your own dataset or use the default UCI Mushroom Dataset.
- Select and compare machine learning models.
- View performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Interactive visualizations of the classification results.
